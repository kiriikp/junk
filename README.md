This is just for my configs and other things that are too small to warrant their own repositories.

### .vimrc

some of the stuff in this (the stuff with the `<++>` marker and the html macros) is from Luke Smith  
the rest is either mine or from random posts

### i3 configs

you may use them for desktop threads if you wish  
a lain wallpaper is provided
